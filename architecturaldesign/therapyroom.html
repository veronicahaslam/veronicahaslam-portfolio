        <p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
        <p>The Interior Design Group Therapy Room project aimed to transform a counseling space at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Academy Hall into a more inviting and functional environment for student therapy sessions. The primary objective was to move away from a sterile, institutional feel and instead cultivate a space that fostered comfort, inclusivity, and well-being. The initiative focused on improving the overall student experience by designing a warm, thoughtful setting conducive to group therapy, all while adhering to strict spatial and budgetary limitations.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Design Constraints and Goals</strong></p>
        <p>The project presented several key challenges that shaped the design approach. Most notably, the room had a limited footprint of just 14’x11’, requiring efficient space planning and multi-functional furniture choices. Additionally, the budget was capped at $10,000, pushing the team to be strategic with product selection. Aesthetically, the design needed to convey warmth and safety, helping users feel at ease while preserving a sense of professionalism appropriate for therapeutic use.</p>

        <p><strong>Planning and Research Phase</strong></p>
        <p>To ensure that the redesign would genuinely meet the needs of its users, the team began by analyzing the existing space and collecting feedback from both students and counseling staff. These insights guided decisions regarding layout, color palette, and material selection. The team prioritized elements that supported relaxation and engagement, using this input to establish a foundation for the design direction and product sourcing.</p>

        <p><strong>CAD Modeling and Product Selection</strong></p>
        <p>We identified four core issues that students faced with shared sinks:</p>
        <p>A detailed CAD model of the redesigned room was developed, allowing for spatial experimentation and refinement of the layout. Accessibility and safety guidelines were considered throughout. The final product selection included ergonomic Focus Side Chairs from Sci Furniture, ambient Pilar Lamps from Hudson Valley Lighting, and functional all-wood lockers from HPL Club. Additional elements like a folding workbench, light-filtering cellular shades, and a sapphire tufted rug added layers of comfort and practicality. Personal touches such as student artwork, collapsible bins, and a chalkboard roll helped make the space feel more approachable and dynamic.</p>

        <p><strong>Final Outcome and Impact</strong></p>
        <p>The completed room features a cohesive design that balances utility and comfort. Soft lighting and cozy textiles help reduce stress and promote reflection, while practical elements like ample storage and flexible workspaces support different group activities. A chalkboard wall serves as a creative and therapeutic tool, encouraging interaction among participants. Rendered views illustrate the thoughtful layout—from the inviting entryway to integrated corner storage—demonstrating how even a small space can be transformed into a welcoming and functional group therapy room.</p>
