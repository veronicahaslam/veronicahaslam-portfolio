                <p><strong>Project Vision & User Focus</strong></p>
                <p>In envisioning the future of 2092, our goal wasn’t to solve global issues like famine but to enhance the dining experience—especially for upper-class households. We focused on creating a product that prioritized luxury, convenience, and sensory experience. Our target user was the high class, so we explored what their presence might look and feel like in the future. Through a curated mood board, we discovered a strong emphasis on sleek aesthetics, fashion, and minimalistic design. This helped guide our visual direction, centering around neutral tones like black, brown, silver, and white to reflect a sense of elegance and refinement.</p>

                <p><strong>Ideation & Inspiration</strong></p>
                <p>During the ideation phase, we considered multiple factors including ease of use, space efficiency, versatility, flavor enhancement, and the right balance of opulence. We looked to modern appliances such as toaster ovens, dehydrators, Keurigs, and air fryers for functional inspiration, while also drawing from imaginative sources like <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em>. While an early concept called the “Glass Stack” won our decision matrix, we ultimately pivoted to a different direction that felt more aligned with our futuristic and luxury-driven goals. Feedback from our initial pin-up helped us refine our design to better capture a high-end, forward-thinking look.</p>

                <p><strong>Problem Statement & Design Approach</strong></p>
                <p>To ground our project, we developed a problem statement using a who/what/where/why format. Our guiding question became: How might we improve the experience of consuming preserved foods by providing convenience, taste, and texture for upper-class U.S. households? This led us to design a product that balanced function and form—offering a seamless experience while aligning with luxury expectations. We aimed to address the shortcomings of many modern appliances, which either overwhelm users with controls or fail when touchscreens become too sensitive and messy during cooking. Our solution prioritizes intuitive input and customization based on what users have and what they want to create.</p>

                <p><strong>Final Outcome & Aesthetic Direction</strong></p>
                <p>Rather than obsessing over mechanical function, we focused our energy on the form and user interface. The final design reflects a balance between beauty and usability: it avoids the chaos of button-heavy panels and the impracticality of oversimplified screens. The result is an appliance that feels futuristic, high-end, and practical—fitting seamlessly into the lifestyle of 2092’s upper class. Our prototype incorporates the colors and styling from the mood board and is designed to elevate the kitchen experience through both visual appeal and thoughtful interaction.</p>

                <p><strong>Final Product</strong></p>
                <p>In the final iteration, we addressed all major feedback by integrating a built-in clamp system with a single-point tightening mechanism and a rubber grip for stability. We added USB ports for more plug versatility and filled out the planter with additional greenery to complete the flower bed-inspired aesthetic. The result is a fully functional, visually cohesive product that enhances customer experience, encourages longer stays, and supports Stacks’ transition into the 5th Wave. We plan to produce and install three final units, starting with gifting our polished prototype to Stacks as a proposed permanent addition to the space.</p>
