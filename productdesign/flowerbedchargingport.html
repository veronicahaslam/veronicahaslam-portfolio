                <p><strong>Design Problem</strong></p>
                <p>Stacks is transitioning into the “5th Wave” of coffee, emphasizing customer centricity, elevated ambiance, and technological integration. However, spatial limitations and a lack of accessible outlets in the back of the shop hindered both comfort and usability—particularly for students and working professionals who frequent the space.</p>
		<p><strong>Design Challenge:</strong> How might we create an environment that makes people stay longer than for a cup of coffee?</p>

                <p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>
                <p>After thorough research of the space, user group, and the owner's vision for Stacks Espresso Bar, our team began ideating with the goal of aligning with the “5th Wave of coffee”—a movement focused on customer experience, refined aesthetics, technological investment, and overall shop excellence. In our interview, the owner emphasized wanting a livelier space with more plants, better use of the back area, and elements that encourage customers to stay longer and interact more. We initially explored two product concepts: a community board that doubled as a coffee bean stand, and a planter box with integrated power outlets. While both ideas were well received, the planter box proved to be more aligned with user needs and Stacks’ aesthetic, offering functionality without disrupting the space.</p>

                <p><strong>Prototyping and Testing</strong></p>
                <p>We built a 12x6x4-inch prototype using pinewood, designed to blend seamlessly into the darker tones of Stacks’ back area. The box included outlets on each side, a foam insert for plants, and c-clamps for table attachment. User testing revealed a desire for USB ports, more foliage for a fuller look, and better cable management to prevent tripping and maintain visual appeal. Critiques also suggested redesigning the c-clamp system for increased security and cleaner integration. Feedback from both Stacks customers and faculty critiques guided us through several refinements, including aesthetic upgrades, more functional wiring, and stress-testing the product in real-world conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Final Product</strong></p>
                <p>In the final iteration, we addressed all major feedback by integrating a built-in clamp system with a single-point tightening mechanism and a rubber grip for stability. We added USB ports for more plug versatility and filled out the planter with additional greenery to complete the flower bed-inspired aesthetic. The result is a fully functional, visually cohesive product that enhances customer experience, encourages longer stays, and supports Stacks’ transition into the 5th Wave. We plan to produce and install three final units, starting with gifting our polished prototype to Stacks as a proposed permanent addition to the space.</p>
